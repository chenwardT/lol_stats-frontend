# lol_stats frontend

This project is the frontend for [lol_stats](https://bitbucket.org/kreychek/lol_stats). The plan
is to make a single-page application (SPA) that pulls data from the lol_stats backend. The backend 
provides a RESTful API as well as supporting AJAX requests for certain utility functions.
